# nwn5e data (served 2da rows and strings)

Phase 3 CM0 (docs/PLAN.md, docs/RE-NOTES.md "Served data"). Everything here is
nwn5e's own content (SRD 5.2 only — non-SRD material goes in the private layer,
`private/data/`, docs/PRIVATE-LAYER.md). No game file is ever copied here.

`build.bat` copies this folder next to the DLL (`build\data`). At start-up the
DLL rebuilds every table that has rows here from the game's own copy (the
override folder, then the key / BIF files in the engine's order) plus these
rows, writes it to `build\served\<table>.2da`, and registers that folder with
the engine's resource manager. The game install is not touched; launching
NWN without nwn5e is vanilla.

## rows/<table>.txt (or <table>.<part>.txt)

One file per 2da table (`rows/feat.txt` → feat.2da), or several (`feat.asi.txt`, `feat.styles.txt`: the part before the first dot names the table). `#` starts a comment.
The first other line names columns of the table; each following line is a
row number and one value per named column:

    # feat.2da: the Ability Score Improvement rows (CM7)
    LABEL               FEAT      DESCRIPTION  ALLCLASSESCANUSE
    1200  NWN5E_ASI_1   16000100  16000101     0

- A row inside the table replaces only the named columns.
- A row past the end of the table creates it (unnamed columns `****`, and
  empty rows fill any gap). Pick new row numbers well past the game's last
  row and keep them stable: feat ids and class ids are saved in characters.
- `"quotes"` keep spaces in a value; `****` is an empty value.
- Rows are shared by both modes; a rule hides its rows in the mode that
  doesn't use them (in memory, once the rules load).

## strings.txt

Names and descriptions for the rows: `<id> <text>`, one per line, `#` for
comments, `\n` for a line break. Ids are 16000000–16499999 (nwn5e's private
range; the label hook serves them, dialog.tlk is not changed). Point a 2da
cell (FEAT, DESCRIPTION, Name, ...) at the id.

    16000100 Ability Score Improvement
    16000101 Increase one ability score by 2, or two by 1 (at most 20). Choose with !asi.
